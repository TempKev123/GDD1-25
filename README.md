This is a starting codebase for GDD Project which was improved on and expanded by team FISTBUMP.  
It features a scoreboard, timer, and powerup tracker on the HUD.   
Additonally, there are now 2 new enemies, first is a ramming alien which moves diagonally, and a dragon with 3 different head sprites.  
The Project has 2 levels of 5 minutes each with power-ups which can 1.increase bullets fired, 2.increase speed of player and 3. change the way bullets are shot.  

This game is coded in java and uses java swing to draw all sprites and backgrounds
